Test 10: check that data type is immutable by testing whether each method
         returns the same value, regardless of any intervening operations
  * input8.txt
    - failed after 13 operations involving BruteCollinearPoints
    - first and last call to segments() returned different arrays

    - sequence of operations was:
          BruteCollinearPoints collinear = new BruteCollinearPoints(points);
          mutate points[] array that was passed to constructor
          collinear.segments()
          mutate points[] array that was passed to constructor
          collinear.numberOfSegments() -> 2
          mutate array returned by last call to segments()
          collinear.numberOfSegments() -> 2
          collinear.numberOfSegments() -> 2
          mutate points[] array that was passed to constructor
          collinear.numberOfSegments() -> 2
